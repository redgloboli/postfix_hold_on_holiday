# postfix_hold_on_holiday
Holds mail delivery in postfix if its holiday or specified day or/and time.

I wrote this to set a specific user to hold queue in postfix for a specific time (e.g. when he's in vacation and on specific days and times during the week) or in general when we have holidays.

At the moment this only works with one user due to the vacation settings only implemented for one user.
